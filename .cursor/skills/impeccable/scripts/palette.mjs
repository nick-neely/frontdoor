/**
 * Brand-seed picker. Returns one OKLCH seed color + the mood it most
 * naturally evokes, and teaches the model how to compose a full palette
 * around it.
 *
 * The seed is the brand's anchor color. The 5-role palette (bg, surface,
 * ink, accent, muted) is composed by the caller at runtime using their
 * judgment + the brief (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md / user prompt), NOT picked
 * from a frozen 4-color preset.
 *
 * Why: 4-color frozen palettes drift toward safe defaults (warm-cream bg,
 * complementary accent on near-white) regardless of brief. A single seed +
 * the model's own composition lets the same seed produce a dark-mode jazz
 * club or a light-mode hospitality brand depending on what the brief calls
 * for. Tested empirically against curated 4-color palettes; seed approach
 * wins on mood-fit in 3 of 5 cases and ties on the rest.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/palette.mjs                  # pick at random
 *   node scripts/palette.mjs --id seed-021    # pick a specific seed
 *   node scripts/palette.mjs --from <key>     # hash <key> to a seed (deterministic)
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   IMPECCABLE_PALETTE_SEED — same as --from; useful for the eval harness
 *     to make runs reproducible.

Seed color (anchor for your primary brand color):
  ${fmtOklch(seed.oklch)} — ${hueWord(H)}${moodHint}

This is the brand's anchor — a single beautiful color. Compose the rest of
the palette around it using YOUR judgment, the brief (PRODUCT.md /
DESIGN.md / the user's prompt), and the color-strategy guidance already in
SKILL.md.

How to use:

1. Read the brief. Write one specific phrase describing the mood this
   product calls for. Be granular. Good: "1970s travel poster — sun-baked
   warmth, considered", "midnight jazz club — smoky brass, saxophone
   light", "Scandinavian winter morning — quiet light through frost". Bad:
   "modern and clean", "warm and inviting". The first lets you compose; the
   second is generic and will produce generic palettes.

2. The seed's hue (${H.toFixed(0)}°) anchors your primary brand color. You
   choose L and C to match the mood. The same hue can be deep-and-velvet,
   bright-and-confident, or pale-and-faded — pick the one the mood demands.
   Primary's hue should stay within ±10° of the seed.${strategyHint}

3. Now compose the full palette in OKLCH (5 more roles):
     • bg       — the most important architectural choice.
                  CORE PRINCIPLE: the mood lives in the BRAND COLORS
                  (primary + accent) and typography, NOT in the surface.
                  A warm brand puts the warmth in its primary against a
                  pure surface. Putting warmth in BOTH primary AND bg is
                  the AI cliché.

                  DEFAULT A — PURE white: exactly oklch(1.000 0.000 0).
                    Not 0.99, not chroma 0.002. The most confident
                    brands in every field — fashion houses, galleries,
                    publishers, tool makers — use literal #ffffff.
                    Don't add hidden warmth.

                  DEFAULT B — PURE black/near-black: L 0.04-0.12,
                    chroma exactly 0.000. No hue tint. Pick L for the
                    mood (cinema dark, gallery dark, instrument-panel
                    dark); C stays 0.

                  ALT 2 — TINTED: chroma 0.015-0.05.
                    Use ONLY when:
                    (a) the mood is EXPLICITLY environmental — the surface
                        IS part of the brand (1920s lacquered interior,
                        leather library, ceramic studio, hotel lobby), or
                    (b) the seed itself is desaturated (chroma < 0.10) and
                        needs a tinted surface to read as a brand.
                    NOT for "feels warm" / "modern + warm" / "moody". If
                    your mood says "warm" but doesn't name a specific
                    environment, use PURE white and let primary carry
                    the warmth.

                  HEURISTIC: if the seed's chroma > 0.10 and the mood
                  doesn't name a specific environment, it's almost
                  always PURE white. Target distribution across many
                  palettes: ~50% pure white, ~25% pure black, ~25%
                  tinted.
     • surface  — bg pulled slightly toward ink (10-15% mix). Same hue
                  family as bg. Used for cards, panels, sections.
     • ink      — body text color. Must reach ≥7:1 contrast vs bg.
                  Can carry the brand hue at low chroma in light mode
                  (slight warmth or coolness toward the brand).
     • accent   — a SECOND brand color, distinct from primary in BOTH
                  hue AND lightness. Picked to complement the mood (not
                  default-complementary across the wheel). Used for
                  badges, status pills, links, accent rules.
     • muted    — secondary text. Ink pulled 40% toward bg, keeping ink's
                  hue. Must reach ≥3.5:1 contrast vs bg.

4. Pick a color STRATEGY (the four steps from SKILL.md):
     • Restrained: tinted neutrals + accent ≤10% — product default
     • Committed: one saturated color carries 30-60% — identity-driven
     • Full palette: 3-4 named roles each used deliberately — brand work
     • Drenched: the surface IS the color — campaign, hero, statement
   The brief picks the strategy. A startup dashboard ≠ a perfume brand.

Hard rules (already in SKILL.md, recapped because the seed step is where
they actually bite):

  - OKLCH only — never hex. Never #RRGGBB.
  - ink-vs-bg WCAG contrast ≥ 7 (body text must be readable)
  - primary chroma ≤ 0.23 (above this, primary glows perceptually and
    no text on it is readable — acid-bright is a UI failure)
  - if primary L > 0.78, primary chroma ≤ 0.18 (the fluorescent zone)
  - primary-vs-accent contrast ≥ 1.7 (they must be visually distinct,
    not two variants of the same hue at similar lightness)
  - accent must carry readable text on a filled badge/pill: EITHER
    saturated (chroma ≥ 0.10) OR clearly light (L ≥ 0.85) OR clearly
    dark (L ≤ 0.30). Never a muddy mid-tone (L 0.45-0.72 + chroma < 0.10)
    — taupe/mushroom/dusty-grey accents read as weak and can't hold text
    either way. Saturate it or push its lightness to a clear light/dark.
  - avoid the saturated AI attractor zones: claude-beige (warm-cream bg
    + dusty brown primary), forest-green-on-cream, AI-purple-on-white,
    navy-cream-with-orange-accent

TEXT-ON-COLOR FILLS — pick by perceptual contrast, not just WCAG. The
rule applies to ANY element where text sits on a saturated color fill:
primary buttons, accent buttons, badges, status pills, tag highlights,
filled callouts. Don't only think "primary button" — apply consistently.

For any saturated mid-luminance color (L between 0.42 and 0.78, chroma ≥
0.08), use WHITE text (or near-white from your bg), not dark text — even
if WCAG says dark technically passes. The Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect
makes saturated colors appear brighter than their luminance suggests,
and dark text on a warm-or-cool-saturated fill reads as muddy.

Convention: saturated action fills in the wild, from fast-food reds to
status pills to filled badges, near-universally carry white text.

Dark text is correct only on PALE fills (L > 0.85) or PURE-NEUTRAL fills
(chroma near 0). Everything else: white text.

Return your composed palette in CSS custom properties using OKLCH, then
build with it. The seed is the start, not the recipe.
